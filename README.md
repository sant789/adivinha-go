## About the Game

In **Adivinha Go**, you will try to guess a number between 0 and 100 within 10 attempts. The game provides hints to help you, indicating if your guess is "quente" (hot) or "frio" (cold). This project is not just about the game; it's also a valuable learning experience for anyone interested in Go programming and terminal user interfaces (TUI).
